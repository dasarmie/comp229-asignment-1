React Portfolio Site

## Overview: Create your Personal Portfolio Website using React

Instructions:
This site must include the pages from your Personal Portfolio 5 pages – your **Home page**, an **About Me** page, a **Projects** page, a **Services** page, and a **Contact Me** page.

1.	Your Site must include the appropriate content for a **Personal Portfolio (65 Marks: Content)**

   
   a.	You must include a **Navigation Bar** or other Navigation scheme that allows the user to view each page of your site.
   
   b.	You must include a **Custom Logo** for your site, this should be placed in or around the main Navigation bar. The Custom Logo can be as simple or artistic as you desire (e.g. you could use a primitive colour-         filled shape like a triangle or hexagon with your initials positioned inside). Please do not use a logo that belongs to another company or person.

   c.	Your **Home Page** should include some sort of welcome message and link or button that allows the user to redirect to your About Me Page and / or other pages. I recommend also including some sort of **Mission Statement**.
   
   d.	Your **About Me Page** should include your legal name, an image of you (I recommend a head and shoulders shot), a short paragraph about who you are. Keep this clean and simple as it may be viewed by perspective employers.
   
   e.	Your **About Me page** should include a link to a PDF version of your Resume.
   
   f.	Your **Projects Page** should include images and information for at least 3 Projects you wish to highlight. These could be current projects you are working on or past projects you have completed. Include an image for each Project and a short description of your role and the outcome. 
   
   g.	Your **Services Page** should include a short list of services you offer (e.g. general programming, web development, mobile apps, etc.). I recommend including images that make this more appealing to view.
   
   h.	Your **Contact Page** should include your contact information in a panel or other construct.
   
   i.	Your **Contact Page** should include a short interactive form that allows the user send you a message and provide basic contact information (First Name, Last Name, Contact Number, Email Address, Message, etc.).       This form does not have to be fully functional initially. However, it should be able to capture the information entered by the user and redirect them back to the Home Page.
   
   j.	Your **JavaScript**, **CSS and Multimedia Asset Files** are functional.
   
   k.	All Your Code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, etc.) is error free.
   
2.	Include **Internal Documentation** for your site **(5 Marks: Internal Documentation)**:
   
   a.	Ensure you include a **comment header** for your **CSS and JavaScript files** that indicate: the
      **File name**, **Student’s Name**, **StudentID, and Date**.
      
   b.	Ensure you include a **section headers** for all of your **HTML structure, CSS style sections**,
      and any **JavaScript functions**.
      
   c.	Ensure all your code uses **contextual variable names** that help make the files human- readable.
